## What does Payload Vault offer
---

What does **Payload Vault** bring to the table (some features, I want to work on/include in the app):
- Save your custom payloads
- Every payload is stored locally
- Categorize your payloads accordingly
- Save time, by simply copy-pasting your payloads!

> Note: More features will be added in the building process.
